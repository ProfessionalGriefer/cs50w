        <h3>My favourite pieces</h3>
        <p>I have played all of the following pieces. A few comments on each masterpiece.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>Chopin</h3>
            <p>My absolute favourite composer as you can see by the length of this section.</p>
            <h5>Revolutionary Etude (Op. 10 No. 12)</h5>
            <p>The only Chopin etude I've played. Memorizing the left hand is very tedious. Many sections are very
            unusual and feel very different from other pieces I've played. But if you've played the piece for a while and
            memorized it completely then it is very satisfying to play.</p>

            <h5>Nocturne in C Sharp Minor (No. 20)</h5>
            <p>Around 2 weeks before my first piano competition(25. - 26. January 2014 Jugend Musiziert) my piano teacher
            told me to play this piece. It was then really hard because I've just played the piano for 2 years but it was the
            most beautiful I've ever played. Because I couldn't play this piece well enough my teacher blew it off.</p>

            <h5>Nocturne in E Flat Major (Op. 9 No. 2)</h5>
            <p>One of Chopin's most iconic piece. I played this piece around 2 years ago and it is very easy but still sounds
            nice. It gets more boring if you play it too often.</p>

            <h5>Fantaisie-Impromptu (Op. 66)</h5>
            <p>The first piece for me that uses left and right hand at a completely different rhythm. I wanted to play this
            piece after seeing it on YouTube. Honestly, it was pretty easy. First, play the right hand only. Second, play the
            left hand only. Third, merge them together. It will sound pretty messy but the rhythm is the only difficult
            part of the piano piece.</p>

            <h5>Ballade No. 1 in G Minor</h5>
            <p>I'm still learning this piece and it takes eternity until I am able to play it perfectly. 12 Sites long with
            complete different melodies and sections on each page and has the complete range of emotions. The beginning may
            <!-- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/embed/ -->
            sound easy but it definitely isn't.</p>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

            </div>
            <p>I could embed a video for every piano piece but I'm too lazy to google all of them.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Liszt</h3>
            <p>Another romantic-era pianist. I wanted to play Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 and La Campanella and quickly
            moved on after seeing the notes. Liszt's music is also very beautiful but it is a lot harder than Chopin's.
            The fingering is absolutely weird and not fun to practice.</p>
            <h5>Liebestraum Nr. 3</h5>
            <p>I love this piece (no pun intended). First encounter with "real" cadenzas.</p>
            <h5>Un Sospiro</h5>
            <p>The sheet music has three bars on it at the beginning and because of it the notes are tiny. The beginning is very
            easy but the middle section was extremely difficult. My piano teacher just sat there and said: "Good, good" with
            no further comments. That is maybe because I'm the only student playing an obsessive amount of romantic-era
            music.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Beethoven</h3>
        <p>Thousand times better than Amadeus. Mozart's melodies are too repetitive and everyone will notice even if you
        miss a single note. The same goes for Haydn. I had a bad experience with Beethoven in my second piano competition. I've
        messed up a Sonatine so extremely that I had to start again. And then I've messed up again and again and again. One of
        the professors walked up and told me to relax, try again and if it doesn't work then move on. My mother had to walk up
        and bring me the music book. After that I had this shaking which ruined my last piece. I still got the 2nd place with
        20 points (21 - 25 points = 1st place). The Schubert improvisation saved me. I still wanted the first place so badly
        to prove another music professor wrong who told me that I was only able to achieve 3rd place with his help.</p>
        <h5>Für Elise</h5>
        <p>Who saw that coming? I think that is the most iconic piece in the piano repertoire. If I sit in front of the piano
        and prepare to play I hear: "Play Für Elise" oftentimes. It was the first piece of my first piano competition. I tried
        to play it too quietly and messed a few notes up.</p>

        <h5>Mondschein Sonate 3rd Movement</h5>
        <p>It is very fast pace, vivid and I love it. The complete opposite to the 1st movement.</p>

    <h3>Postface</h3>
    <p>The list goes on and on and on and on because there are so many beautiful piano pieces worth mentioning. But this won't
    benefit my coding skills (and I am really excited for Python).</p>
