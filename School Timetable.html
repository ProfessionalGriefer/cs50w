    <h1>My Timetable</h1>
    <p>My current timetable for the EF. EF is German and is the abbreviation for <i>Einf√ºhrungsphase</i>
    or introductory phase. This school year's function is to prepare you for the Q1 and Q2, two school years
    where you collect points for your <i>Abitur</i>. After your final exams your collected points represent
    a grade.</p>

    <p>The maximum amount of points is 900 which represents a 1,0. In Germany you write
    a comma instead of a dot to display float values and a dot instead of a comma to seperate groups of 3
    digits. In the American school system a <i>Grade Point Average</i> (GPA) of 4.0 represents a perfect
    score but in Germany it means the you have barely made it.</p>

    <p>The lessons are 45 minutes each and 90 minutes for a double lesson. Each
    lesson is seperated by a 5 minutes break and each double lesson is seperated by a 20 minutes break.
    After the 6th lesson we get a 60 minutes break. In my opinion this is too much. I rather go earlier
    home to advance in the CS50X lessons.</p>

    <p>In the grades 5 to 10, the so called <i>Unterstufe</i> (lower grade) you get a
    substitution teacher if your teacher is missing. But in the <i>Oberstufe</i> (upper grades?) it is a
    free hour. You can stay in school in the <i>Oberstufenraum</i> (upper grades room?)
    or you can go home. At some days you have so many free hours that you only come for the first two hours
    for example.</p>

    <h3>Subjects assessment</h3>
    <p>I really love all the <i>Naturwissenschaften</i> (sciences). Math is great, but way too easy
    (boring). Chemistry and Biology are great. My grades are A for both but I have to kick one out to
    avoid having too many hours per week. I chose Chemistry over Biology because I don't want to
    memorize thousands of different technical terms. If you understand the topic in Chemistry then you
    don't have to learn at all. The Social Sciences (SW) is together with English my advanced course.
    I really love economy and politics (Sociology is okay). Writing English text is not very hard but
    writing it in a eloquent and gramatically correct way is a challenge on it's own. I chose the
    billingual branch. This means that Geography and History is also in English. This is really an
    advantage in my English classes. History and Geography are great but the <i>Klausuren</i>
    (exams) are very different. I got my worst grade in the History exam: C+. This is also the only C
    I have ever got in this year. Geography exams on the other hand are very easy. When my History
    teacher went into <i>Elternzeit</i> (parental leave) we got a history teacher from USA/Michigan.
    And ironically he is the funniest and coolest teacher I have ever met. He also plays League of
    Legends in his freetime.<br>
    German is the new Latin. I am glad that I don't have to deal with the<i>Bestimmen und √úbersetzen</i>
    (determining and translating)
    anymore. The lessons are dull and boring. I chose Music over Art and I love it. I am myself a piano
    player and the lessons are fun and exciting. My friends always talk bad about art because they
    analyze more than they draw: "The author drew the picture in a vertical format. This creates together
    with the missing symmetry a very unrest atmosphere...." Philosophy could be really awesome. I had
    two competent teachers who I really admire. But this "almost pensioner" miss really takes the fun
    out of it. I don't learn anything new in the lessons, we don't write anything down and we watch the
    same movie scenes (Kant f√ºr Anf√§nger) for 2 weeks. She doesn't try to give effort into her
    explanations but surprises us with a test. Her marks range from 2 to 4 (B to D) because she doesn't
    give the gradings any second thoughts. What a pity!
